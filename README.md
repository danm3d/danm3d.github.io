## About Me 
I am an experienced game and software developer currently working as a course coordinator and lecturer for a leading multimedia technology college in Pretoria, South Africa. 
I have been making games both as a hobby and a profession for 7 years and have a keen interest in 3D Art, Animation and Computer Graphics.
I am currently working in education, teaching 3D modeling and animation using Blender, as well as game development in Unity.
