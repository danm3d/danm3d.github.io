### Development Intern
### [Microsoft AppFactory](https://www.microsoft.com/africa/4afrika/appfactory.aspx)
#### January 2015 - June 2015
The AppFactory provided exposure to working in the software industry and taught skills that I still today. As an intern, I was tasked with the upkeep of the database of apps created through the program, and worked with several emerging technologies (for the time) including the Windows UWP Platform, Windows Phone and Windows 10.
I was required to give app workshops and have given short courses on app development on Microsoft Platforms at educational institutions including Unisa, Nelson Mandela University and the University of Fort Hare.
It was during this time when I began to attend the monthly MakeGamesSA meetups held at the Microsoft Campus, which helped push me towards a career in Game Development that I desperately sought after. 6 month into the internship, I was headhunted by Luke Lamothe to work at his company, 24 Bit Games.

## Education
### Bachelors in Technology: Software Development
### [Nelson Mandela University](https://www.mandela.ac.za/)
#### 2011 - 2014
I first learned how to make games in university, where I began tinkering with Microsoft's XNA Framework and Blender 3D, before being introduced to Unity towards the end of my second year.

In my third year of study, I worked with 2 friends to develop a project, simply titled _"JOHN"_ as our final year submission project. It was a 3D action RPG set in an anachronistic fantasy world. Our group went on to participate in the South African finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup.

In My fourth year, I created a game titled _"NETTED"_, a 3D side-scrolling puzzle platformer designed to educate players on digital information security and how to be safe in an online world.

I received my National Diploma in 2013 and my BTech in 2014.
